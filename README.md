## A fully functional webpage that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to simulate reaslistic tennis match outcomes
## https://supposeduck30.github.io/tennis-match-simulator/
This project is easy to use and was built with no external libraries. The simulator:
- Inputs player names and rankings
- Simulates matches using realistic probability
- Simulates a coin toss to decide who serves first, and then alternates serves every game
- Is deployed via github static pages

## üïì Version History

## üß† How it works 

#### 1. The user inputs rankings for the player

#### 2. A coin toss decides who serves first

#### 3. Each game is influenced by a serve hold probability of the server (Higher rank means higher probability to win service game)

#### 4. This is then simulated game by game

#### 5. If it is 6-6, a tiebreak is simulated
